#Pypipe

  Pypipe is an pipemenu script for the [Openbox][] window manager. It outputs a list of files in a directory sorted by their time modified. With the newest files listed first, its useful for directories like your downloads folder. The syntax is straight forward:

    pypipe.py ~/downloads

In the future, other ways of sorting might be enabled.
